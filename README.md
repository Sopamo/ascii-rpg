### The Wilderness
#### The sphinx
The sphinx blocks the way.
It offers the player to either walk away unscathed, solve the riddle it's giving them and be allowed to pass, or be attacked if they answer incorrectly.
The riddles are:

"Flowing from trees, sweet and sticky, a treat so fine,
What essence could this be, in a dark bottle, a hidden sign?

Found in the midst of 'bell' and 'tall', it stands upright and true,
Amidst words like 'silent' and 'pearl', it stands firm, straight as a sentinel too.

The sound of movement, continuous and flowing,
It’s the tail end of verbs where life is showing.

Now string them together and answer this thing,
What young tree is sprouting, ready for spring?
sapling"


"Amid eerie whispers and ghostly cheer,
Find the beginning of laughter you fear.

Through the raven’s gaze, where night does descend,
Look to its core, where shadows extend.

In the haunted woods, beneath the elder tree,
The final sound of the eldest sets you free.

Now string them together and speak to the night,
Which fragrant bloom calms with its sight?"


"First think of what comes before 'possible',
When nothing seems right and cannot be done.

Consider the start of the time when the sun starts to shine,
It's early, not late, and often quite fine.

Lastly, a part of 'crystal' you must find,
At the end, it's sharp and shines in your mind.

Now string them together and give what you're called,
A word that means never to perish, always enthralled."


### The Town
#### The angry person
They are angry because their close relative died because of Elara's accident.

#### Marla the Widow
Marla lost her husband to the dark curse that plagues the town. Her days are now a relentless struggle against grief and decay. Through tearful recollections, she explains to Echo how the curse has drained the hope and vitality from the town, leaving its people to live in desolation.

#### Bram the Cobbler
Once a celebrated craftsman, Bram now watches his thriving trade crumble before his eyes. The curse has corrupted even the finest materials, rendering his artisan skills useless. In his broken state, Bram recounts the slow deterioration of the town and warns Echo that the price of life under this dark spell is steep and irreversible.

#### Lorin the Beggar
Lorin wanders the desolate streets, a bitter witness to the decay around him. His voice, tinged with sorrow and resignation, tells Echo the harsh truth of how the curse has exploited the vulnerable, leaving no soul untouched by misery.

### Echo's Final Decision Options

The necromancer reveals that in order to revive Echo, he cast a dark spell over the town, leaving the townspeople truly sick and broken. Echo is then given two choices:

- **Sacrifice His Second Life:**  
  Echo can choose to sacrifice his second chance at life to lift the curse, thereby healing the townspeople at the cost of his own existence. This tragic sacrifice redeems the town but leaves Echo as a martyr, questioning what real life means.

- **Continue His Second Life:**  
  Alternatively, Echo may decide to keep his second life, accepting the persistent suffering of the townspeople. This choice allows him to continue living, albeit burdened with guilt and moral ambiguity, opening the door for further quests and redemption efforts.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
