### The Wilderness
#### The sphinx
The sphinx blocks the way.
It offers the player to either walk away unscathed, solve the riddle it's giving them and be allowed to pass, or be attacked if they answer incorrectly.
The riddles are:

"Flowing from trees, sweet and sticky, a treat so fine,
What essence could this be, in a dark bottle, a hidden sign?

Found in the midst of 'bell' and 'tall', it stands upright and true,
Amidst words like 'silent' and 'pearl', it stands firm, straight as a sentinel too.

The sound of movement, continuous and flowing,
It’s the tail end of verbs where life is showing.

Now string them together and answer this thing,
What young tree is sprouting, ready for spring?
sapling"


"Amid eerie whispers and ghostly cheer,
Find the beginning of laughter you fear.

Through the raven’s gaze, where night does descend,
Look to its core, where shadows extend.

In the haunted woods, beneath the elder tree,
The final sound of the eldest sets you free.

Now string them together and speak to the night,
Which fragrant bloom calms with its sight?"


"First think of what comes before 'possible',
When nothing seems right and cannot be done.

Consider the start of the time when the sun starts to shine,
It's early, not late, and often quite fine.

Lastly, a part of 'crystal' you must find,
At the end, it's sharp and shines in your mind.

Now string them together and give what you're called,
A word that means never to perish, always enthralled."


### The Town
#### The angry person
They are angry because their close relative died because of Elara's accident.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
