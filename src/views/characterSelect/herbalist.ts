<strong>Personality and Backstory:</strong>
Elara Moonwhisper is a lonely and introverted herbalist who has fled her past in search of a fresh start. She was once part of a prestigious herbalism guild, but a tragic accident involving a misidentified herb led to the death of a patient. Haunted by guilt and shame, Elara abandoned her former life and set out to create a comprehensive catalogue of medicinal herbs, hoping to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
Elara is quiet and reserved, preferring the company of plants and animals to people. She is fiercely dedicated to her work and will stop at nothing to document every known medicinal herb in her herbadex. Despite her introverted nature, Elara has a deep empathy for all living creatures and will go out of her way to help those in need.

<strong>Goals:</strong>
Complete the herbadex, documenting every known medicinal herb in the land.
Find a way to redeem herself and make amends for her past mistake.
Use her knowledge to help those in need, and perhaps find a sense of belonging and purpose.`
